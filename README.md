  <h2>About the Project üß†üñãÔ∏è	</h2>

 <p>
We are diving into the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing, commonly known as NLP. 
 </p>
 <p>
We will explore the fundamental concepts and techniques behind NLP. We will look at how machines process and analyze large amounts of natural language data, the challenges they face, and the solutions developed to overcome these challenges.
</p>
<p>
By the end of this session, you will have a deeper understanding of how NLP works and the potential it holds for the future. So, let's embark on this journey to unravel the complexities of human language through the lens of technology.

  <h3>How this lesson works:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Read the slides:</strong> There are a few introductory slides so I'll recommend you to take a look at them. They have enough info to understand what is NLP and how it works.</li>
    <li><strong>Download dataset:</strong> After the slides, we will run a python notebook to do a quick NLP project. It fuels by a Amazon Review Dataset with more than 50k entries... it's a little big large so you can <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C2k72MkqNUpQ6GOPJQfWNwQoe4mfDR_J/view?usp=sharing">download from here</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong>Run the notebook:</strong> After download the csv file into this rep folder, charge the python notebook and follow the cell lines order. We will develop together a VADER Sentiment Analysis and a Transformers Mood Analysis.</li>
